# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

One product version covers the whole monorepo. Every pull request adds its line under
`## Unreleased`; `pnpm version:bump` dates those lines under the new version. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#versioning).

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Versioning — The version is bumped by hand with `pnpm version:bump`, which also regenerates the
  OpenAPI document and the API reference, instead of on every merge into `main`; every pull request
  adds its own line to this changelog.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-13

### Added

- First versioned release — Everything merged into `main` up to this point.
- Workflow engine — JSON workflow definitions stored in the database, with typed steps (form, file
  upload, OTP, terms and conditions, manual review, scoring), conditional validation and
  transitions, and versioned publishing.
- Public onboarding API — Start an onboarding, read its current step schema from `/state`, submit
  step data, and receive state changes through client webhooks.
- Connectors — Sync and async execution, fallback between providers, HMAC verification, and
  adapters for HTTP, SMTP/MailHog, SendGrid, Twilio Verify, Sumsub and Veriff; credentials are set
  up from the admin panel.
- Audit and security — Audit logs for engine decisions, webhooks and error responses, and
  encryption of personal data at rest.
- Admin panel — Azure SSO sign-in, onboarding list and details, audit log with filters, connector
  setup, and workflow list, details and creation.
- Documentation — A Docusaurus site with guides, an API reference generated from the engine's
  OpenAPI document and a gallery of the workflow fixtures.
- OpenAPI document — The engine's HTTP contract is generated from its route and DTO decorators,
  committed, and served at `GET /v1/openapi.json`.
- Agent skills — Claude Code skills for authoring workflows and building BFFs against the engine,
  with golden-set evals.
- Tooling — Docker Compose stack with Garage as the local object store, and the engine image
  bundling the admin panel.
